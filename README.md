# Multiple-Object-Detection-using-Fully-Convolutional-Neural-NetworksDetectron2 Beginner's Tutorial

This is a modified verion of the original Detectron2 Tutorial notebook. In this version the Train on a custom dataset section is removed and focuses on only Object Detection, Segmentation and Panoptic Segmentation on images and video clips.

The original notebook can be found on the Detectron2 Github repo.

Welcome to detectron2! This is the official colab tutorial of detectron2. Here, we will go through some basics usage of detectron2, including the following:

    Run inference on images or videos, with an existing detectron2 model
    Train a detectron2 model on a new dataset
